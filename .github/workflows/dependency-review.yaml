# Dependency Review Action
#
# This Action will scan dependency manifest files that change as part of a Pull
# Request, surfacing known-vulnerable versions of the packages declared or
# updated in the PR. Once installed, if the workflow run is marked as required,
# PRs introducing known-vulnerable packages will be blocked from merging.
